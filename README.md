WorldEditSelectionVisualizer (WESV) is essentially the famous [WorldEditCUI](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2171206-172-worldeditcui/) mod in the form of a Bukkit plugin, which means that players don't need to install anything on their client.

- Option to only show the selection when holding the selection item
- Configurable particle effect and view distance
- Prevent players from spawning too many particles when selecting huge regions
- Highly customizable for the performance of your server
- Supports both [WorldEdit](https://enginehub.org/worldedit) and [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fastasyncworldedit.13932/)
- Compatible with all Minecraft versions starting with 1.7.10
- Support for RGB color codes in messages on Minecraft 1.16 and higher, with the `&#rrggbb` format
